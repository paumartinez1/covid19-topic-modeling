<h1>Project Description</h1>
This project employs topic modeling techniques using the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model on the COVID-19 Open Research Dataset (CORD-19) to categorize and analyze the surge of COVID-related publications. The research tracks the evolution of topics from the onset of the pandemic in December 2019 through 2023, revealing shifts from treatment-focused discussions in early 2020 to prevention and the broader impacts of the pandemic by 2022-2023.

<h1>Key Takeaways</h1>

### 2018 - Early Discussions on Coronaviruses
- The research in 2018 predominantly focused on general medical topics, with a notable presence of discussions related to MERS-CoV and other coronaviruses. This indicates that the scientific community was already aware of the potential threats posed by coronaviruses, reflecting an established concern over emerging viral threats and the importance of early prevention strategies.

### 2019 - Increased Focus on Bat-Origin Viruses
- By 2019, there was a noticeable shift towards studies on bat-origin coronaviruses, propelled by the emergence of COVID-19 cases at the end of the year. This shift underscores the significance of understanding zoonotic transmission as a crucial aspect of pandemic preparedness.

### 2020 - Intensive COVID-19 Research
- The onset of the pandemic in 2020 led to a dramatic pivot in scientific efforts towards understanding and combating COVID-19. Research extensively covered public health responses, the virus's impact on mental health and education, and the vulnerability of different populations. This year highlighted the swift mobilization of the global research community in response to an unfolding health crisis.

### 2021 - Focus on Solutions and Broader Impacts
- In 2021, the focus expanded to developing antiviral vaccines and exploring the pandemic's broader societal impacts. The emphasis was not only on direct health interventions but also on adapting to new normals, such as the impact on education and the application of AI and technology in diagnosing and managing the disease.

### 2022 - Analyzing the Pandemic's Comprehensive Impacts
- Research in 2022 continued to deal with the pandemic's extensive and varied impacts, emphasizing sustainable solutions and revisiting public health strategies. This reflects a mature phase of pandemic research where the focus has broadened from immediate crisis response to long-term consequences and learning from the pandemic to enhance future preparedness.
